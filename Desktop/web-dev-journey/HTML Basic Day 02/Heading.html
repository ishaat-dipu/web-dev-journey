<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based <em>hypertext</em> system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late <small>1990</small>. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, <strong>Berners-Lee</strong> listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
